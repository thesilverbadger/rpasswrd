rpasswrd
========

rpasswrd is the Ruby on Rails port of a non-trivial licence key/password application that I write when learning something new.

Backstory
---------

When learning a new language or framework, I always find HelloWorld examples too simplistic.  In order to get a feel for the environment, I like to start using it in anger.  When I first set out to learn .NET, I decided that a text file of application licence keys was a prime target for a little app - the idea has stuck and whenever I want to learn something new (MVC, RavenDB, Ruby on Rails), I always revisit the app idea and refactor or rewrite.

This is the Ruby on Rails incarnation.

Requirements
------------

* Ruby (I'm using 2.0.0 but 1.9.3 should be fine).
* Rails (3.2.13, but I shall be upgrading to 4 soon).
* PostgreSQL
